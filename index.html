                <p class="texto-lateral">Programming is my dream since I was young. From the moment I touched my first
                    code, I knew this was what I wanted to do in life. The magic of bringing an idea to life through
                    lines of code fascinates and motivates me every day.<br>
                    For me, programming is a universal language that transcends borders and cultures. It is a means to
                    solve problems and make the world a better place. Through programming, I am able to create
                    applications, websites and software that positively impact people's lives.<br><br>

                    My passion for programming leads me to always be learning and improving my skills. I enjoy facing
                    challenges and looking for creative solutions to every problem. Each line of code is a small
                    achievement that pushes me forward in my dream of being an exceptional programmer.<br><br>

                    I dream of working on innovative projects that revolutionize industries and contribute significant
                    technological advances. I want to be part of collaborative development teams, where I can learn from
                    others and contribute my unique skills.<br><br>

                    Programming is more than a job for me, it is a passion that fills me with excitement and
                    gratification. Every time I see my code working correctly or someone using a tool I created, I feel
                    immense satisfaction. <br>

                    In my dream, I imagine creating applications that solve social and environmental problems, using
                    technology as a positive force in the world.<br><br>

                    I know that the road to my dream will not be easy, but I am willing to face the challenges and
                    persevere. Programming is my calling and my passion, and I will not rest until I make this dream
                    come true and contribute to the world through my work as a programmer.
